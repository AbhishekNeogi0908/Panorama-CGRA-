numbher of cycles needed to execute the whole kernal.

Nested lops: 
-> inner loop is fine, we are able to map it into CGRA :- My work.
-> Now we need outer loop execution cycles.
	-> Either get the number of cycles outer loop takes to run on CPU or any some kind of data (suggested)//(formula , or latency and II)
		->
	-> Or we must find a way to find the latency of the outer loop


how to find the latency of outer loop?
-> inner loop cycles * number of outer loop itterations + (number of itteration * latency of outer loop without inner loop) 

something freq. or anything liek latency or time for the outer loop -> Time / freq => number of cycles



IMPORTANT things to study :- 

Modulo scheduling

For handling if else cases :- partial predication & full predication

High level synthesis :- c code to FPGA mapping
